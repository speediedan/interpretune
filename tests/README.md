## CI Environment Variables

- **IT_CI_LOG_LEVEL**: Defaults to `INFO` at the repository level. You can override this variable at the workflow or step levels in GitHub Actions to enable more detailed logging (e.g., set to `DEBUG` for verbose output).

- **CI_RESOURCE_MONITOR**: Defaults to `0` at the repository level. You can override this variable at the workflow or step levels to enable basic CI resource logging. This is useful for debugging resource exhaustion issues on default GitHub Actions runners.

For more details, see the main CI workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/ci_test-full.yml`.
