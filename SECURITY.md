# Security Policy

Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Interpretune, please report it privately to the maintainers by opening an issue with the label "security" or by emailing the maintainer listed in `pyproject.toml` (see `authors`). For high severity issues or if you prefer responsible disclosure, include a clear reproduction case and any relevant data.

## Policy

- Critical issues will receive an expedited fix and, where appropriate, a coordinated disclosure plan.
- Do not include secrets, keys, or private data in public issue reports. If you need to share sensitive information, request an alternative private channel in your initial issue.

## Contact

- Primary maintainer: Dan Dale <danny.dale@gmail.com>
