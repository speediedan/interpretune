    "Interpretune includes a lightweight in-notebook analysis injection utility that can temporarily instrument adapter packages (for this notebook, `circuit_tracer`) with small, configurable hooks named analysis points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tooling is intentionally experimental and most useful for short-lived, exploratory work: it lets you quickly inspect intermediate values, add ad-hoc diagnostics and exposition (as in this notebook), and prototype ideas without changing the adapter's source tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we set `enable_analysis_injection = True` in our parameters cell above to enable the runtime patching. The orchestrator validates hooks, applies them to the target package path, and registers the analysis point functions you provide (whether sourced from files or notebook cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>More on Analysis Injection</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ephemeral: patches are applied in-process for the notebook session only and do not persist to source files.\n",
    "- Configuration-driven: hooks are registered via YAML configs plus analysis function mappings that can live in this notebook, external files, or any mix of the two.\n",
    "- Flexible composition: you can load the base YAML and analysis hook functions from external files, then override or extend them inline in subsequent notebook cells.\n",
    "- Notebook-friendly output: each analysis point's collected data is available via various helper methods on the `orchestrator` (e.g. `get_analysis_data`, `get_output`), allowing later cells to display the captured values without re-running the instrumentation (as is done in the attribution analysis exposition of this notebook). Analysis events are also written to the configured log (e.g. `/tmp/attribution_flow_analysis_<timestamp>.log`) and optionally to the console when enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `analysis_injection` utility is a powerful exploratory and expository tool, but for ongoing or production workflows you should upstream a proper hook interface in the relevant adapter package.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Guidance on Analysis Injection Usage</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you or other users find a recurring need to access intermediate analysis variables, the more robust and maintainable solution is to add a small hook interface to the adapter package itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why prefer adapter-level hooks over regex-based patching:\n",
    "- Stability: explicit APIs are far less brittle than runtime regex patching.\n",
    "- Maintainability: adapter maintainers can review, test, and document hook APIs so they remain supported across releases.\n",
    "- Performance and safety: built-in hooks can be designed to avoid unintended side-effects or excessive overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an adapter would benefit from exposing intermediate analysis variables, Interpretune recommends opening an issue or a pull request against the adapter repository proposing a small, well-scoped hook API (describe the use case, example call signatures, and what guarantees callers should expect). This is the recommended path for any capability you expect to use repeatedly or across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use which approach:\n",
    "- Use `analysis_injection` for short experiments, expository notebooks like this one, ad-hoc debugging, or rapid iteration on ideas.\n",
    "- Propose adapter hooks (issue/PR) when you want a repeatable, supported, and long-term inspection facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details and guidance on safe usage patterns, see the Interpretune project documentation and repo: https://github.com/speediedan/interpretune\n",
